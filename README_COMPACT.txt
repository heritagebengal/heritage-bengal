To keep your jewellery website compact, you can safely delete the .github and .vscode folders. Your essential structure should be:

- index.html
- products.html
- product-details.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- css/ (for styles)
- js/ (for scripts)
- assets/ (for images)
- README.md (optional)

This will ensure a clean, minimal setup for a static website.

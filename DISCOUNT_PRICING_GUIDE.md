# Discount Pricing System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Heritage Bengal e-commerce platform now supports optional discount pricing display with strikethrough original prices, discount percentage badges, and final discounted prices.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
Added optional fields to the product schema:
- `original_price` (Number): Original price before discount
- `discount_percentage` (Number): Discount percentage (e.g., 25 for 25% off)

### 2. Frontend Display Logic
- **Products Page**: Shows discount pricing in product cards
- **Product Details Page**: Shows discount pricing in product information section
- **Automatic Fallback**: If no discount data provided, displays normal price

### 3. UI Components
- **Strikethrough Price**: Original price with line-through styling
- **Discount Badge**: Green badge showing percentage off (e.g., "25% off")
- **Final Price**: Prominently displayed discounted price in Heritage Bengal gold color

## Usage

### Adding Products with Discount Pricing
```json
{
  "name": "Heritage Gold Necklace",
  "price": 15000,
  "original_price": 20000,
  "discount_percentage": 25,
  "description": "Beautiful handcrafted necklace",
  "category": "Necklaces",
  "stock": 5
}
```

### Display Logic
The system automatically detects discount pricing when:
1. `original_price` exists and is greater than `price`
2. `discount_percentage` exists and is greater than 0
3. All three fields contain valid numbers

### CSS Classes Used
- `line-through` - For strikethrough original price
- `bg-green-100 text-green-800` - For discount percentage badge
- `text-heritage-gold` - For final discounted price
- `font-number` - For consistent number formatting

## Files Modified

### JavaScript Files
- `js/product.js` - Added `renderProductPrice()` method for product details page
- `js/products-api.js` - Added `renderProductPrice()` method for products listing page

### Server Files
- `server-simple.js` - Updated schema to include discount fields
- Product schema now includes `original_price` and `discount_percentage` fields

## Testing
- Created test product with 25% discount (₹20,000 → ₹15,000)
- Verified both products page and product details page display correctly
- Confirmed fallback to normal pricing when no discount data present

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing products without discount fields display normal pricing
- No changes required to existing product data
- Optional fields ensure system works with both old and new product formats

## Example Display
### With Discount:
```
₹20,000  [25% off]
₹15,000
```

### Without Discount:
```
₹15,000
```

The system provides a professional e-commerce discount display that enhances the shopping experience while maintaining the Heritage Bengal brand aesthetic.
